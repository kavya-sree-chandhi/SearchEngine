# Semantic Similarity Search

## ðŸ“– Introduction

This project demonstrates how to use [Sentence Transformers](https://www.sbert.net/) to compute sentence embeddings and analyze semantic similarity among a collection of sentences. It includes code to calculate a similarity matrix and to find the closest matching sentence to a given query.

---

## ðŸš€ Overview

- **Embeds a list of 30 diverse sentences** using the `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` model.
- **Computes a cosine similarity matrix** between all pairs of sentences.
- **Provides a function** to find and display the closest match for any new input sentence based on semantic similarity.
- Useful for **semantic search**, **chatbot retrieval**, and **natural language understanding** demos.

**Sentence Embedding**

A list of sentences is embedded using the all-MiniLM-L6-v2 model from Sentence Transformers. Each sentence is converted into a fixed-length numerical vector (embedding) that captures its semantic meaning.

**Similarity Matrix Calculation**

Cosine similarity is computed for each pair of sentence embeddings. This produces a similarity matrix, which quantifies how semantically close each sentence is to the others. The matrix is printed as a readable report, showing the similarity score between each pair of sentences (values closer to 1 mean higher similarity).

**Semantic Search / Closest Match**

The function get_closest_match takes a new query sentence, computes its embedding, and compares it to all stored embeddings using cosine similarity. It returns the most semantically similar sentence from the list, demonstrating how the model can retrieve relevant information based on meaning, not just keywords.
