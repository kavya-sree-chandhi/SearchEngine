# Semantic Similarity Search

## ğŸ“– Introduction

This project demonstrates how to use [Sentence Transformers](https://www.sbert.net/) to compute sentence embeddings and analyze semantic similarity among a collection of sentences. It includes code to calculate a similarity matrix and to find the closest matching sentence to a given query.

---

## ğŸš€ Overview

- **Embeds a list of 30 diverse sentences** using the `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` model.
- **Computes a cosine similarity matrix** between all pairs of sentences.
- **Provides a function** to find and display the closest match for any new input sentence based on semantic similarity.
- Useful for **semantic search**, **chatbot retrieval**, and **natural language understanding** demos.
